## Getting Started

Witho those instructions You will be able to install and run project locally on Your ouw machine.

### Prerequisites

Before You install project You need to have installed on Your machine:

###### Eas way
`git`, to fetch project, and `docker` to run project

###### Hard way
`git` to fetch project, `node`, `npm` or `yarn` to start project.
